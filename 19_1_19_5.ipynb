        "The root or zero of a function, $f(x)$, is an $x_r$ such that $f(x_r)=0$. For functions such as $f(x)=x^2−9$, the roots are clearly 3 and −3. However, for other functions such as $f(x)=cos(x)−x$, determining an analytic, or exact, solution for the roots of functions can be difficult. For these cases, it is useful to generate numerical approximations of the roots of f and understand the limitations in doing so."
